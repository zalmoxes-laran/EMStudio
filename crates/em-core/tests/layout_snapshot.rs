//! Layout regression snapshot on the TempluMare fixture.
//!
//! The unit tests in `layout.rs` pin *rules* on tiny hand-built graphs: newest
//! lane on top, paradata below its unit, directed edges pointing down. They say
//! nothing about what happens when 215 nodes and 536 edges are laid out at
//! once — which is where a change to spacing, ranking or lane assignment
//! actually shows up, and where it is easiest to move something by accident
//! while fixing something else.
//!
//! So this pins the whole output. The fixture is known-good (F1/F2 rebuilt it
//! with deterministic ids) and the layout is demonstrably stable, so any diff
//! here is a real behavioural change: either intended — re-bless the snapshot —
//! or a regression. The test's job is to make you look, not to forbid change.
//!
//! Re-bless after an intended change:
//!
//! ```bash
//! UPDATE_LAYOUT_SNAPSHOT=1 cargo test -p em-core --test layout_snapshot
//! ```
//!
//! then READ the diff before committing it.
