//! Per-node-type box geometry, read from the s3Dgraphy visual rules.
//!
//! Until EM1 every leaf node got the same box — `default_node_w × default_node_h`
//! (90×32) — whatever its type. That was fine while every type was drawn as a
//! full-box shape, and stopped being fine when BR became a black rhombus at 0.7×
//! height: the drawing was 22×22 and the box it reserved (and the box the click
//! answered to) was still 90×32.
//!
//! # Why the table is COMPILED IN, from the vendored datamodel
//!
//! `lib.rs` promises that the EM language is not hardcoded here, and it is not:
//! this module hardcodes no type and no number, it reads
//! `frontend/src/assets/em_visual_rules.json` — the pinned vendored copy that
//! `frontend/scripts/sync-datamodels.sh` refreshes from s3Dgraphy (ADR-001), the
//! same file `palette.ts` and the renderer read.
//!
//! Compile time rather than runtime for one reason, and it is the determinism
//! contract (invariant 7): the same document must lay out identically in the CLI,
//! in WASM and on the desktop. A table passed in by each caller would make that
//! true only as long as three callers agreed; a table baked from one file makes it
//! true by construction. The WASM delivery could not read the file at runtime
//! anyway — it is a single inlined binary with no filesystem.
//!
//! If the vendored file moves, this crate stops compiling. That is the intended
//! failure: loud, at build time, instead of a layout that silently drifts.
