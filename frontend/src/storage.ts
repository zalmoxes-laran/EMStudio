/**
 * W1 · STORAGE — where the bytes live, and what a "collection" is.
 *
 * Two things live here, and they are separate on purpose:
 *
 *  1. **the bridge's filesystem client** (`fsList`, `fsFileUrl`). A window
 *     cannot read a disk path: served over http, `/Users/…/x.jpg` resolves
 *     against the origin and the dev server answers *200 text/html* — measured
 *     — so an <img> fails in decode with no honest error to catch. The bridge
 *     reads the disk because it is the only side that can, and the page reads
 *     the bridge. Every byte a window shows comes through `fsFileUrl`.
 *
 *  2. **the collection (U3)**. A resource is not always one file: it can be a
 *     FOLDER of photographs, or a multi-page PDF. Rather than teach each window
 *     the three cases, everything downstream — Viewer, Gallery, and tomorrow the
 *     annotator — iterates an ORDERED LIST OF ITEMS. A single image is a
 *     collection of one. That is the whole abstraction, and it is designed for N
 *     from the start even where this phase produces 1 (see `pdf` below).
 *
 * The module never touches em.json and never renders: it answers questions.
