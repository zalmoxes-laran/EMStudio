/**
 * THE SHELF — the wide list.
 *
 * The analogy that settles it (E.D.): in a video editor there is a file
 * BROWSER, an ASSET list, and a TIMELINE. You drag from the browser into the
 * asset list — and *there* the material gets its checksum and its index — and
 * from there into the edit. Here it is the same three: **file browser → shelf →
 * graph/annotator**. The shelf IS the asset list.
 *
 * Browser ≠ shelf, and the difference is curation. The browser shows everything
 * on the disk, including what will never belong in the documentation; the shelf
 * holds what you CHOSE, with a digest and an index. Which is why the shelf is a
 * saved list (Model A) and not a computed view of a folder's orphans (Model B).
 * The orphan scan does not disappear — it becomes an ENTRANCE, "add to the
 * shelf", rather than being the shelf.
 *
 * It is a GRAPH, so it saves and reopens like everything else: a ShelfGraph
 * (`graph.data.em_collection === "ShelfGraph"`), the same convention Heriverse
 * and s3Dgraphy already use — reuse, not a third format. Standalone across
 * studies, or a member of the multigraph.
 *
 * Each entry carries the two axes the design note calls for:
 *
 *   · **scope** — which of the three FENCES it comes from: `own-study`,
 *     `own-HDT`, or `other-HDT` (a COMPARANDUM, from another site's twin).
 *     Not decoration: search must be filterable by fence and the UI must show
 *     it, because whether a thing is mine, my twin's, or another site's changes
 *     what a comparison means.
 *   · **residency** — `reference` (the URI stays at home) or `resident` (copied
 *     into my own store). Tropy's linked/managed, same idea.
 *
 * Pure module: no DOM, no network. The checksum comes from the bridge (the
 * browser cannot hash a file it is not allowed to read), and is passed in.
