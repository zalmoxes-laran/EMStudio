// module carries ONLY the ephemeral selection/focus channel: it mutates no
// graph data, so there is no ownership/collision concern (the op-log data
// channel is a separate, later phase).
//
// Wire format (JSON text frames), WIRE 2 — the envelope and the BODY are
// separate namespaces, and `wire.ts` says why at length:
//   { v:2, type:"select", source:"emstudio", payload:{ node_id, node_ids? } }
// `source` (the envelope's) lets a peer ignore its own echo; nothing inside
// `payload` can ever collide with it.
