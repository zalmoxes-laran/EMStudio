/**
 * Sign in to a StratiGraph Server, from EMStudio — Authorization Code + PKCE.
 *
 * The half of the handoff the link deliberately does NOT carry. A deep-link says
 * `{server, room}`; this is how the app turns that into a token that belongs to
 * the person sitting here rather than to whoever forwarded the link.
 *
 * **The token never touches disk.** Not localStorage, not the settings file, not
 * a cookie — the same rule the AI key follows in this codebase, and the same one
 * `sync.ts::HubOptions` states: a token on disk outlives the reason it was
 * issued. It lives in a module variable for this session, and the PKCE verifier
 * lives in `sessionStorage` only for the length of the round trip and is deleted
 * on read.
 *
 * **No client secret.** A desktop app and a browser build are both PUBLIC
 * clients: a secret shipped inside them is a secret published. PKCE is what
 * replaces it, and `code_challenge_method=S256` is not optional here — `plain`
 * would make the interception it prevents possible again.
 *
 * This is a port of the node console's `auth.js` (which the server serves for
 * its two web faces), not a second design. What differs is only what must: it
 * signs in against a server named at RUNTIME by a link, so nothing about the
 * endpoint can be baked in, and on the desktop the redirect comes back through
 * the app's own deep-link handler rather than through a page load.
