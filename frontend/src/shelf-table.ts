/**
 * SHELF · THE TABLE — the shelf as the library sees it.
 *
 * The wide list (`shelf.ts`) is what you drag into; this is the shelf READ BACK
 * from s3Dgraphy, as rows. The difference matters and it is the whole reason
 * this module exists: three of the columns are things only the library can
 * answer —
 *
 *   · **RESIDENCE** (disk / minio / uri) — read off the locator, plus what the
 *     origin says about where it came from;
 *   · **ROLE** (comparandum / internal_source) — STATED, never derived, and
 *     orthogonal to the fence: my own asset can be a comparandum and somebody
 *     else's URI can be a source inside my own argument;
 *   · **MODE** (only_shelf / used_in_graph) — the hatting reference-check across
 *     every graph of the container.
 *
 * …and answering them here, in TypeScript, would be a second answer. A shelf
 * with two opinions on "is this in use?" is worse than a shelf with no badge, so
 * this module computes NOTHING about a row. It parses what the bridge returned
 * (`api.shelf_table` / `api.shelf_table_columns` / `api.resource_roles` /
 * `api.access_modes`), keeps the column order the library gave, and turns values
 * into class names without knowing what any of them mean.
 *
 * That constraint is checkable, and `scripts/check-shelf.mjs` checks it: there is
 * no locator regex in this file and not one of the badge VALUES appears in it.
 *
 * Pure module: no DOM, no fetch. The caller does the round trip.
