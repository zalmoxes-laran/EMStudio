/**
 * The two themes, and the ONE place the canvas gets its colours from (DARK1).
 *
 * The chrome is CSS (`style.css`, `:root` + `[data-theme="dark"]`); a canvas
 * cannot read CSS variables, so the renderer needs the same palette as an object.
 * The keys mirror the CSS token names on purpose: a colour changed on one side is
 * findable on the other, and the two cannot drift into "nearly the same grey".
 *
 * # What is NOT in here, and why it matters
 *
 * The **semantic colours of the EM language** — the fill and border of a US, the
 * teal of an SE, the group title tabs, the document variant colours — come from
 * `em_visual_rules` (s3Dgraphy) and never from a theme. They are DATA about the
 * language, not decoration: a US is that red in both themes, or the two themes
 * would disagree about what the drawing means, and a screenshot from one would
 * mislead a reader of the other.
 *
 * So the theme supplies what is AROUND them: canvas, lanes, panel chrome drawn on
 * the canvas, label ink, selection rings, the connect handle, the group container
 * wash. Where a semantic fill needs help to stay readable (a label ON a coloured
 * node), the theme adapts the LABEL, never the fill — see `labelOn`.
