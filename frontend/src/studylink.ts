/**
 * WHERE A STUDY IS, out of a URL — read by BOTH pages.
 *
 * The Catalog's «open in…» hands out an address, and two EMStudio pages have to
 * understand it: the READER (`/em/read/`, where somebody handed a link reads a
 * study) and the EDITOR (`/em/studio/`, where somebody works on one). Two doors,
 * two verbs, and until this file existed only one of them could read the link —
 * the editor answered «Drop an .em.json file here» over a perfectly good
 * `?emjson=`, which is a button that worked and a door that did not.
 *
 * **One implementation, not two.** It lived inside `reader.ts::documentUrl()`,
 * and copying it into `main.ts` would have created two grammars for one query
 * string. They would not have diverged on day one; they would have diverged the
 * first time somebody added a parameter to the page they were working on.
 *
 * The forms, in precedence order — the Catalog's own two, and nothing invented
 * here:
 *
 *     ?emjson=<url>              the container itself (what `/open` hands out)
 *     ?study=<id>&catalog=<base> a study id against a catalogue
 *     ?study=<id>                …resolved against THIS origin, which is right
 *                                whenever the page is served by the node that
 *                                also runs the Catalog — the arrangement
 *                                `/em/studio/` exists to create
 *     ?narrative=<id>            which narrative, when a study holds several
 *     ?token=<jwt>               for a restricted study, used and not kept
 *
 * **Relative is allowed and is the good case.** `?emjson=/catalog/study/…` names
 * the container on the origin the page came from, which cannot be wrong: the
 * fetch resolves it against `location`. The Catalog already writes that form for
 * its own reading page, after a mixed-content failure measured in Chrome (an
 * https page told to fetch `http://localhost:8010/…`). Nothing here needs to
 * turn it into an absolute URL, and doing so would reintroduce exactly that bug.
