/**
 * "Open this room in EMStudio" — the deep-link, consumed.
 *
 * This kills the hand-typed Hub. Before it, joining a room meant three fields in
 * Settings — an address, a room name, and a token pasted out of a terminal — and
 * the third one was a secret travelling by clipboard.
 *
 * The contract is StratiGraph Server's (`app/handoff.py`), and its security
 * property is the whole design:
 *
 *     stratigraph://open?server=<addr>&room=<id>
 *
 * **The link carries a PLACE, never a permission.** No token, no ticket. This
 * module reads `{server, room}` out of it and then signs in AGAINST THAT SERVER
 * by itself — Authorization Code + PKCE, public client, token in memory. So a
 * link in a chat, a screenshot or a bug report leaks nothing, and the token
 * belongs to whoever clicked rather than to whoever forwarded.
 *
 * **A link is not a membership.** If the caller has no grant, the room refuses
 * and the remedy is the INVITE (`members.ts`), which is a different link that
 * carries a role. Conflating the two would turn "here is where it is" into
 * "here, have access".
 *
 * Two ways in, one reader:
 *
 * * **desktop** — the OS hands the app a `stratigraph://` URL (registered in the
 *   Tauri bundle) and Tauri delivers it as a deep-link event;
 * * **web** — the same parameters arrive on this page's own query string, which
 *   is what the server's `/open` page falls back to.
 *
 * The grammar is deliberately re-implemented here rather than fetched: a client
 * that had to reach a server to find out WHICH server to reach would not be able
 * to start. It is kept honest by `check-handoff.mjs`, which measures this reader
 * against the same links the server's own parser is measured against.
 */

/** What a handoff names, and all it names.
 *
 *  TWO ACTIONS ON ONE NAMESPACE, and that is the design the scheme was renamed
 *  for: `stratigraph://` is the ecosystem's, so the Catalog opens a STUDY and the
 *  room browser opens a ROOM through the same handler. A consumer registers one
 *  scheme and reads which of the two it was handed.
 *
 *  Before this, a study link could not work by construction: the catalogue
 *  emitted `stratigraph://open?study=<id>` and this parser refused it with «the
 *  link names no room» — into `logWarn`, i.e. the app's console, not in front of
 *  whoever had pressed the button. Measured in Chrome on 4 September. */
