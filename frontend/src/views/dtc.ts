// DTC view: the digital-twin-creation substrate of the WHOLE graph — the
// provenance of the digital resources the EM record rests on, read as one
// picture instead of one resource at a time.
//
// Where `buildDtcGenesisScene` (views/context.ts) answers "how was THIS resource
// made?" by walking upstream from a single Resource, this answers "what digital
// work does this graph stand on?" for every DTC chain at once.
//
// FULL RENDERING (2026-08-09). The first cut laid the substrate out with the
// generic layered algorithm, which drew a correct graph that said nothing about
// what a DTC chain IS. This lays it out as the chain reads: a lane per STAGE of
// making, in order, from what was acquired to what the record cites.
//
//   ┌ Ingressi ─────────  resources nothing produced — what entered the study
//   ├ Processi ─────────  the acquisition / processing events
//   ├ Prodotti ─────────  what they produced
//   ├ Processi (2) ─────  a second act, consuming those products…
//   ├ Prodotti (2) ─────  …and producing more
//   └ Uso nel record ───  the EM nodes that cite them
//
// The lanes are RANKS, not four fixed roles (2026-08-09b). A chain of two
// processes — scan, then model from the scan — used to fold onto four bands with
// the second process's input drawn in "Prodotti" and its arrow running back UP,
// against invariant 3. A rank is the longest path from the start of the chain,
// so every arrow points DOWN by construction and a longer chain simply gets more
// lanes. Each lane is NAMED after what it holds, and repeated roles are numbered.
//
// Same swimlane mechanism as the Matrix, so the renderer already draws the bands
// and their labels; reading down is reading one act of digital making, reading
// across a lane is comparing the same stage across the whole graph.
//
// Arrows still point DOWN (invariant 3): a process is below what it consumed
// and above what it produced.
