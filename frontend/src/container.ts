/**
 * The em.json CONTAINER — a project is one file.
 *
 * Decided with E.D. (2026-08-13): an em.json/emj is **always a container**::
 *
 *   { "header": {…}, "graphs": { "<id>": <graph>, "shelf": <ShelfGraph> },
 *     "active_graph_id": "<id>" }
 *
 * A study is one or more graphs plus its shelf; a single graph is a
 * **container-of-one**. This is the shape **Heriverse already reads**, so
 * writing it means Heriverse does not change — the format was adopted, not
 * invented. s3Dgraphy reads and writes the same thing (`s3dgraphy/container.py`),
 * so the three tools agree on what a project file is.
 *
 * What changes for EMStudio: **Save writes every slot**, not just the active
 * one. Until now a workspace with three graphs saved one of them, and the other
 * two existed only until the tab closed — which is the kind of loss you discover
 * a week later.
 *
 * Reading accepts both shapes, always: every file written before today is a
 * single-graph document, and none of them may break.
 *
 * Pure module: no DOM, no store. It maps between container documents and the
 * per-graph `EmDocument` the DocumentStore already knows how to hold.
