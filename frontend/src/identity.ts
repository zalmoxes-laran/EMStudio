/**
 * IDENTITY — the ORCID iD is who you are; verification says who checked.
 *
 * The model, before any code:
 *
 *   An archaeologist on a dig, with no network, adds themselves with **their
 *   ORCID iD alone**. They DECLARE it — claimed, not verified — and that is
 *   enough to work: create, edit, annotate, save, author every node they touch.
 *   Nothing about preparing data waits for a connection.
 *
 *   On the first connection they verify that iD through ORCID, and only then
 *   does **publishing as that person** unlock. Claim now, verify later; publish
 *   only if verified.
 *
 * Why the gate sits exactly there. Authorship inside your own document is a
 * statement you make to yourself and your team; the graph records who did what,
 * and being wrong about it costs a correction. Publishing is a statement to
 * everyone else, permanently, under a name that belongs to a real person with a
 * real record — and there, "I typed my colleague's iD by mistake" is not a
 * correction, it is a false attribution in somebody else's bibliography.
 *
 * What is secret and what is not:
 *
 *   · the **ORCID iD** is a PUBLIC identifier. It is printed on papers. It may
 *     sit in localStorage in clear text, and it does here.
 *   · the **tokens** from the identity broker are secrets, and they follow the
 *     LLM key's rule exactly: OS keychain or session memory, and NO READ PATH —
 *     nothing in this module returns a token, the same way nothing returns the
 *     API key (see `tauri.ts`: there is no `getLlmKey`, on purpose).
 *
 * This module is PURE except for `localStorage`: no DOM, no network. The
 * network lives behind `IdentityProvider`, so the flow is testable without any
 * infrastructure — and so Keycloak can be wired in later without this file
 * knowing it exists.
