/**
 * StratiMiner — assisted graph creation from a folder of unstructured sources.
 *
 * The panel makes a two-step pipeline visible instead of hiding it behind one
 * button:
 *
 *     a folder of sources  --(AI)-->  em_data.xlsx  --(deterministic)-->  em.json
 *
 * Both halves are here, and the seam between them is a FILE the archaeologist
 * can open. That is the whole design: the model canonises source material into a
 * typed table, the table is reviewed, and only then does a plain importer turn
 * it into a graph. **The AI never writes the graph.** A model asked for em.json
 * directly would put an unreviewed guess straight into the language's own
 * format, where a wrong node type reads exactly like a right one.
 *
 * Two paths reach the table, and neither is a fallback for the other:
 *
 *  * **Path A (API)** — the bridge calls a model itself and materialises the
 *    workbook. Fast, but it only sees what the bridge can decode as text: PDFs
 *    need an extractor this build does not bundle, and the panel says so per
 *    run rather than letting a table built from filenames look complete.
 *  * **Path B (Cowork)** — copy the prompt, run it in a session that has the
 *    filesystem, get the workbook back. Slower, and the only honest answer today
 *    for a folder of PDFs.
 *
 * Both end at the same field: a path to em_data.xlsx, and one button that
 * converts it.
 *
 * **The panel asks the question first (POL3).** The steps used to be numbered
 * 1 · 2 · 3 as if everyone had to walk all three, so a user who already had a
 * table met two AI-shaped steps before the one they needed — and the fact that
 * the AI is *optional* was invisible. Now the first thing on screen is «how do
 * you have the table?», with two answers that converge on one **Graph creator**:
 *
 *     by hand ────────────────────┐
 *                                 ├──► em_data.xlsx ──► Graph creator ──► em.json
 *     a folder of sources ─(AI)───┘
 *
 * A relabel and a reorder of the pieces that were already here: the extract, the
 * prompt and the transform calls are untouched.
 *
 * Why this is a panel and not a modal: the source folder and the table are
 * things you come back to across a working session — a modal would make the
 * pipeline feel like a one-shot import, which is exactly the reading the
 * intermediate table exists to prevent.
