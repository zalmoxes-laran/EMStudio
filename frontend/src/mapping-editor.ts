/**
 * THE MAPPING EDITOR — authoring the JSON that importers apply.
 *
 * StratiMiner's twin, and the pairing is the design: StratiMiner turns a folder
 * of sources into a graph THROUGH a reviewable table; this turns a source's
 * shape into a **mapping file** that importers then apply, dynamically or baked.
 * One makes a graph, the other makes an instrument. Both are one-shot tools that
 * exist to produce an artefact and get out of the way — which is why this is a
 * floating tool under Tools ▸ and not a window you arrange a project around.
 *
 * The gesture: drop in a source (a table or an XML) → see every field with three
 * of its values → say for each what it MEANS → say how the fields connect →
 * export the JSON.
 *
 * ## What this module does not know
 *
 * Not one node type, not one edge type, not one CIDOC class is written in this
 * file. They all arrive in `state` from `api.mapping_*` over the bridge:
 *
 *   · the field list and its samples          → `mapping_source_fields`
 *   · the classes on offer, CIDOC-first        → `mapping_target_catalog`
 *   · the edges legal between two of them      → `mapping_allowed_edges`
 *   · whether the result is coherent           → `mapping_validate`
 *
 * That is not tidiness. A picker with its own list of types is a second
 * datamodel, and the single thing this editor exists to produce is a file that
 * agrees with the first — so `scripts/check-mapping-editor.mjs` reads this source
 * and fails if a type name appears in it.
 *
 * The one string this file DOES have to carry is the schema's own vocabulary
 * (`is_id`, `property_name`, `relations`, …): those are the mapping FORMAT, which
 * is what this module is a writer for.
 *
 * Pure module: no DOM queries outside the host it is given, no fetch. The caller
 * does the round trips and hands the answers back in `state`.
