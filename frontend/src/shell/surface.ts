/**
 * THE CONTRACT · one window type, ONE way of being drawn.
 *
 * Written before anything was converted, and that order is the point.
 *
 * EMStudio used to draw a window two ways: the singleton surfaces inside
 * `#canvas-wrap` for the window that had the focus, and `buildSecondarySurface`
 * for every other one. Parity between the two paths was an invariant kept BY
 * HAND, type by type — measured on 2 September (`check-focus-parity.mjs`),
 * levelled on 9 August for the graph, the table and the panels, and every time
 * the comment left behind tells the same symptom: the tab strip re-measures, the
 * head loses the sheet name, the story starts 28 px higher.
 *
 * The types that still moved were the ones nobody had levelled. The defect was
 * never in a type: it was in there being two paths. So this interface is not a
 * tidy-up of the two — it is the statement that there is one, and the place a
 * ninth window type is forced to be born into.
 *
 * THE LAW, in one line:
 *
 *   > the focus decides where the events go, never what is drawn.
 *
 * which is Blender's (`ScrArea` always draws, `wmWindow->eventstate` only
 * routes), and which is why `setFocused` is allowed so little: it may turn
 * input handling on and off and it may draw the focus ring. It may NOT change
 * what is visible, nor how it is laid out. `check-surfaces.mjs` walks the AST of
 * every `setFocused` in `shell/` and fails on a geometry write, a `render*`
 * call, or an `appendChild` — so the rule is a thing the compiler can see, not a
 * thing a reviewer has to remember.
