/**
 * THE ARRANGEMENT AS GEOMETRY · the split tree turned into rectangles.
 *
 * Why this exists, measured rather than argued (2026-09-12).
 *
 * The tree used to be rendered as NESTED FLEX BOXES, which meant every leaf's
 * area was a child of a `.tile-split` that was itself a child of another one —
 * so any change to the arrangement, and any change of FOCUS, re-parented the
 * areas. Re-parenting is what `tileRoot.innerHTML = ""` did in one line, and
 * three modules existed to compensate for it: `surface-scroll.ts` put the
 * readers back, `wrapWin` remembered whose surfaces the wrap held because the
 * focus had already moved on, `releaseTilePanels` rescued the singleton panels
 * from the reset.
 *
 * The two candidates were measured against each other before choosing:
 *
 *  · KEEP THE FLEX and defend the reuse: the areas would have to be pulled from
 *    a cache and re-appended into freshly built splits on every structural
 *    change. Every registry (`tileCanvases`, the EM-Data hosts, the Storage
 *    hosts, the surface repaints) would still need clearing and rebuilding,
 *    because a re-append is a detach — so the whole of the bookkeeping stays,
 *    and only the focus path gets better.
 *  · RECTANGLES: the areas are absolutely positioned children of `#tile-root`,
 *    created once and NEVER MOVED. A split, a join, a ratio drag, a magnify and
 *    a window resize are then four numbers written onto an element that is
 *    already where it belongs. Nothing is ever detached, so nothing has to be
 *    put back — and the registries simply survive.
 *
 * The second is shorter, and shorter in the part that matters: it deletes the
 * compensations instead of narrowing them. It also makes the arrangement
 * testable in node with REAL numbers (this module is pure arithmetic over the
 * tree) instead of a hand-modelled layout that a checker had to simulate.
 *
 * The cost, stated: the browser no longer reflows the arrangement on its own, so
 * a resize has to recompute. That is one listener, and it was already there for
 * the canvas.
