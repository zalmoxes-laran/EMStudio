/**
 * THE SIX, CONVERTED · one constructor per window type, focused or not.
 *
 * Each of these was two pieces of code an hour ago: a singleton inside
 * `#canvas-wrap` that only the focused window could use, and a branch of
 * `buildSecondarySurface()` for every other area. Here there is one, and the
 * window that has the focus gets exactly the same object as the window that does
 * not.
 *
 * WHAT `setFocused` DOES HERE, and it is a finding rather than a shortcut: for
 * these six types it sets a hook class and nothing else — because the
 * interactive chrome had ALREADY been moved into the window header on 9 August
 * (HDR2), and the header is built by one builder that every area calls. So by
 * the time the two paths were merged there was nothing left that only the
 * focused mount could do. The class carries no box metric, and
 * `check-surfaces.mjs` asserts that by walking this file's AST.
 *
 * The renderers are NOT here. They live in `main.ts` next to the state they
 * read, and arrive through `SurfaceDeps` — so this file can be parsed, and its
 * `setFocused` bodies read, without dragging 18.000 lines behind them.
