/**
 * N6 — who wrote this, and who vouches for it.
 *
 * Three states, and the difference between them is the whole point:
 *
 *   `human`        a person wrote it and signed it
 *   `ai_draft`     a model wrote it and **nobody has vouched for it yet**
 *   `ai_endorsed`  a model wrote it and a named person put their name to it
 *
 * The state is **derived, never stored** — exactly as in s3Dgraphy's
 * `narrative_node.Block.status`. A stored status could disagree with the facts
 * (a block marked "endorsed" with no validator), and on a claim about an
 * archaeological site that disagreement is not a display bug.
 *
 * Everything here writes through the ordinary `DocumentStore` mutations, so an
 * authorship change is undoable, marks the document dirty, reaches a synced
 * peer and is written by the existing save. There is no parallel format: the
 * narrative-level author is a `has_author` EDGE (the N4 model), the
 * chapter-level author is `chapter.authored_by`, and an endorsement is
 * `block.validated_by`.
 *
 * Nothing in this module ever sets `validated_by` on its own. Endorsement is an
 * act by a person; pressing "generate" is not one.
