/**
 * P4.3 — the room client: what EMStudio decides when it talks to an StratiGraph Server.
 *
 * A PURE module on purpose. Everything here is "given these messages, what
 * should happen" — the URL to open, whether the local history is still usable,
 * which operations to send, who is in the room. No socket, no DOM: the socket
 * lives in `sync.ts` and the screen in `main.ts`, and this can be exercised with
 * a fake one (`scripts/check-hub.mjs`).
 *
 * Three decisions live here, and the middle one is the reason this step exists.
 *
 * **The wire is already ours.** The relay (P4.2) speaks the ADR-002 messages
 * EMStudio has always spoken, so joining a room needed no new protocol — only a
 * different endpoint and a token.
 *
 * **The rebase.** P4.2 left one honest gap: a client that comes back with local
 * history OLDER than the hub's compaction point could re-send operations about
 * things the hub has already forgotten, and resurrect them. So the hub announces
 * its `gc_watermark`, and a client whose base is older than it does NOT replay:
 * it re-syncs from the snapshot — the state of record — and re-sends whatever of
 * its own work survived, as NEW operations, stamped now. Nothing is dropped
 * quietly, and nothing comes back from the dead.
 *
 * **Awareness, never a lock.** Presence says who is here and what they are
 * looking at. It never prevents an edit — that is the design's choice (P4 §6),
 * and the reducer here has no concept that could be used as one.
