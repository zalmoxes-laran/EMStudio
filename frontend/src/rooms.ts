/**
 * CREATING A ROOM, AND PUTTING A FILE ON IT — the two gestures EMStudio lacked.
 *
 * The decision they implement is not «modes» but THREE VERBS (design note
 * `EM_design_aprire-entrare-creare.md`, 5 September 2026), and the question that
 * decides everything is **where the copy you are editing lives**:
 *
 *   on your disk  →  it is not a room, and the node knows nothing about it;
 *   on the node   →  it IS a room, always — even with one member.
 *
 * A room with a single member is not a degenerate room: it is *your table*. The
 * gain from that choice is that a concept DISAPPEARS — there is no «editing
 * online without a room» — and with it the ambiguous case where nobody knows who
 * is keeping what.
 *
 * This module is the PURE half: deriving an id, and turning an open container
 * into the operations that seat it on a table. No fetch, no DOM, no settings —
 * which is what lets `check-rooms.mjs` put real values to it.

/**
 * The room id a name produces.
 *
 * DERIVED, never typed twice. A person types a NAME; the id is a consequence,
 * because two things that must agree are two things that will one day disagree.
 *
 * ⚠ THIS ALGORITHM IS SHARED WITH THE NODE'S FRONT DOOR
 * (`stratigraph-server/app/rooms_ui/rooms.js::createRoom`). Two doors that
 * derive it differently would make the SAME name into two different rooms, which
 * is exactly the ambiguity the one-room-one-graph rule exists to prevent. The
 * agreement is not assumed: `check-rooms.mjs` and the server's
 * `test_room_id_parity.py` assert the same vector of names, so a change to
 * either side that is not made to both turns a suite red.
 *
 * Collisions are the SERVER's to refuse (409, and its sentence is shown). This
 * function does not check for them — asking first and creating second is two
 * answers where one is authoritative.

/**
 * THE UPLOAD THAT TURNS A FILE INTO A PLACE — as operations, not as a payload.
 *
 * Why operations rather than a new endpoint that swallows an em.json: the relay
 * already has exactly five idempotent verbs and a merge that arbitrates them
 * (P4.1). A seeding endpoint would be a SIXTH way for a graph to enter a room,
 * writing straight into the snapshot store past the convergence rules — and the
 * first time it raced a connected client the room would have two truths and no
 * ledger saying which arrived first. Composing the verbs it already has costs
 * one walk of the document and keeps one path in.
 *
 * Nodes before edges, because an edge naming a node the room has not seen is an
 * edge the room has to hold in the air. The relay tolerates it; a reader looking
 * at the room mid-seed would not.
 *
 * NOT STAMPED HERE. `add_node` carries the node's OWN `modified_at`/`created_at`
 * if it has one — the same rule `opsForLocalChange` follows. Re-stamping on the
 * way in would make every node in a ten-year-old excavation look like it was
 * recorded the afternoon somebody uploaded it, which is the audit trail lying
 * about its own age.

/**

 * The rule from the prompt, and it is the ladder applied rather than a second
 * mechanism: **if you are not confirmed, the gesture asks for the rung first —
 * not a form.** Creating a room writes an ACL naming its owner, so the node has
 * to know who that is; `POST /v1/rooms` answers 401 for exactly this reason.
 *
 * So this returns WHICH RUNG IS MISSING, and the caller does what the chip would
