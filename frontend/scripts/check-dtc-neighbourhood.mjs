// DTC-NEIGH · executable check of two things that were written twice.
//
//   node scripts/check-dtc-neighbourhood.mjs
//
// **The classification.** Which edges are the DTC chain used to be written in
// three places: by name on the node (`s3dgraphy.dtc`), and by PREFIX here —
// `views/dtc.ts` and `views/context.ts` both carried `startsWith("dtc_")` with
// the comment «and whatever the datamodel adds next». That comment was the good
// intention holding the defect: it PRESUMED every future `dtc_*` edge would be
// chain, so a `dtc_annotated_by` that was context would have been a corridor on
// the client and not on the node — two rules with one name, and the client's the
// one nobody would think to check.
//
// The fix was not to align the prefix to the three names. It was to take the
// decision away from the client: the datamodel marks them (`dtc_role: "chain"`,
// connections 1.6.13), it travels through `sync-datamodels.sh` like everything
// else, and both sides read it.
//
// **The adapter.** The node's neighbourhood answer becomes a Scene, and a group
// stays a group: a flight of two hundred photographs is an acquisition whose
// members hang off it by `dtc_had_output` — a CHAIN edge, so the expansion
// legitimately returns all two hundred. Drawing two hundred boxes to say «a
// flight» is what makes a provenance picture unreadable, and the fold belongs in
// the adapter rather than as collapse logic inside the view.
