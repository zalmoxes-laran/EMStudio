//
// WHAT THIS FILE USED TO BE, and why it changed trade (12 set 2026).
//
// EMStudio drew a window two ways: the singleton surfaces inside `#canvas-wrap`
// for the window that had the focus, and `buildSecondarySurface()` for every
// other one. Parity between the two was an invariant kept BY HAND, type by
// type — and this check measured it: the head, the box, what the head promised.
// It was honest work and it found real things (the shelf's nine controls, the
// narrative's 28 px, the table's re-measured head).
//
// But a check that measures the distance between two paths accepts that there
// are two. Six types have one now, and for those the question "do the two mounts
// agree?" has no referent. So for them this asserts something stronger and much
// cheaper to keep true: THERE IS NO SECOND PATH. No singleton in the markup, no
// branch in `applyWindowSurface`, no row in `FOCUSED_SURFACE_BOXES`, no mention
// in `buildSecondarySurface` — and `selectWindow()` does not rebuild the tree.
//
// The types that were NOT converted keep the old clauses, and they are named
// here in clear: a fence that protects half a repo without saying which half is
// worse than two fences.
//
// And the rule of the house (5 ottobre): a guard that searches for a word inside
// a source read as text measures the FILE, not the PROGRAM. Everything below
// goes through `sorgenti.mjs` — the TypeScript compiler for the code, `linkedom`
// for the markup, the parsed rule for the stylesheet — or through the module
// itself, imported and run.
