// HANDOFF · the deep-link, read the way EMStudio reads it.
//
// The link is the ecosystem's contract (`stratigraph-server/app/handoff.py`) and
// its ONE security property is that it carries a place and never a permission.
// So the check is not only "do we parse it" but "would we ACCEPT a token in
// one" — a reader that tolerates a credential is a reader whose next caller
// sends one.
//
// The grammar is implemented twice on purpose (Python on the server, TypeScript
// here): a client that had to reach a server to find out WHICH server to reach
// could not start. Two implementations of one grammar drift unless something
// measures them against the same strings — this file holds those strings, and
// `stratigraph-server/tests/test_handoff.py` holds the same ones.
