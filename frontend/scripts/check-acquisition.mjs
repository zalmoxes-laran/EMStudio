// ACQUISITION · executable check of the delivery funnel — F1/F2/F3/F4.
//
//   node scripts/check-acquisition.mjs
//
// The properties here are not about pixels or about the graph; they are about
// WHAT THE APP IS ALLOWED TO ASSERT ON SOMEBODY'S BEHALF. Three of them would be
// re-broken by one convenient line, and one of them WAS broken (the default
// licence shipped, measured, in every fresh panel), which is why they are
// asserted in a file that runs rather than written down in a report:
//
//   1. NO DEFAULT LICENCE. A preselected licence is a legal statement nobody
//      made — the same species of error as a default password;
//   2. THE DEPOSITOR IS NOT A FIELD. It comes from the token; a box for it is a
//      box where a name that is not yours can be typed;
//   3. THE AUTHOR IS NOT ASSUMED TO BE THE DEPOSITOR. One digitises a
//      colleague's photograph, deposits it, answers for having published it, and
//      is not its author;
//   4. A SERIES IS A GROUP. Writing per file must not mint one acquisition per
//      file — which is exactly what the corpus would do with an unnamed lot,
//      because it derives the id from the members when there is no name.
//
// A static read of the sources, like the other checks in here: there is no DOM in
// node, and what is measurable without one is the shape of the code that decides.
