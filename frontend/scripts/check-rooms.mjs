/**
 * THE TWO GESTURES · create a room, and put this file on it.
 *
 * `src/rooms.ts` is the pure half — an id from a name, and a container turned
 * into the operations that seat it on a table — so it is bundled with the
 * project's own esbuild and exercised in node, with real values.
 *
 * The one that matters most here is the PARITY VECTOR. The room id is derived
 * from the name in TWO places — this app's File menu and the node's front door
 * (`stratigraph-server/app/rooms_ui/rooms.js::createRoom`) — and two doors that
 * derive it differently turn one name into two rooms, which is precisely the
 * ambiguity «one room, one live graph» exists to prevent. The same vector is
 * asserted by `stratigraph-server/tests/test_room_id_parity.py`, so a change to
 * one side that is not made to the other turns a suite red in whichever repo the
 * author was not looking at.
