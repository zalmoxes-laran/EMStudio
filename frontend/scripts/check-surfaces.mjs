// SURFACE-AUDIT · executable check of the shell: `src/shell/layout.ts` (the
// arrangement as arithmetic) and `src/surface-scroll.ts` (the discipline that
// keeps a window's CONTENT and its PLACE).
//
//   node scripts/check-surfaces.mjs
//
// WHAT CHANGED (12 set 2026), because half of this file existed for a reason
// that is gone.
//
// It used to open by saying: «the DOM here is a small stand-in with real numbers
// (linkedom has no layout, so `scrollTop` would always be 0 and nothing could be
// measured)». That is still true of scrolling — a headless DOM has no layout —
// but it was ALSO true of the arrangement, and the arrangement was modelled by
// hand here because the geometry lived inside nested flex boxes that only a
// browser could resolve.
//
// It does not any more. `shell/layout.ts` computes every area's rectangle from
// the split tree with plain arithmetic, so §0 below runs the REAL function on
// REAL trees and checks real numbers — no model, no simulation.
//
// And the two mechanisms this file used to reproduce are one:
//
//   · GONE · `renderTiles` DETACHED `#canvas-wrap` and re-attached it, zeroing
//     every `scrollTop` inside (measured in a browser: 900 → 0). Nothing is
//     detached now, so `rememberScrollsIn`/`restoreScrollsIn` are deleted and
//     the cases that exercised them with them.
//   · LEFT · a surface MIGRATES: the same window's content is a singleton
//     element while it has the focus and a box built into an area when it does
//     not. Two types still do this — the narrative and the annotator — and for
//     them the machine below is still what carries the reader across.
//
// Frames are modelled, because the clamp is the whole reason the module writes
// twice: `requestAnimationFrame` here collects callbacks, and `frame()` settles
// the heights (what a browser's layout pass does) and then runs them.
