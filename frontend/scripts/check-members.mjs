// MEMBERS · executable check of src/members.ts — what is LEFT after the panel
// was retired, and a fence so it does not come back.
//
//   node scripts/check-members.mjs
//
// ## What this file used to check, and what happened to it
//
// It checked a PANEL: a viewer shown no controls, an owner's row with no role
// dropdown, an invite token rendered once, a role as a PUT and a revocation as a
// DELETE. Twenty-nine assertions about a surface that was retired on 8 September
// 2026 — `EM_design_condividi-e-firma.md`, Regola IV: «EMStudio, il chatbot e il
// catalogo ci portano un link, mai una copia del pannello».
//
// Those assertions are NOT deleted. They became the test of absence below, with
// the reason beside each one, so whoever puts the panel back has to read why it
// left before their diff goes green. Two measured reasons:
//
//   1. it showed HALF THE ACL. Teams can hold a role in a room since
//      7 September (`PUT /v1/rooms/{id}/groups/{gid}`) and this surface never
//      drew one. A panel that tells you it is showing half is still a panel
//      somebody decides an access on;
//   2. it minted a DIFFERENT invite link. `inviteUrl()` pointed at this build;
//      the node's panel takes the link from the door the node declares. Two
//      addresses for one door, and which one an invited person got depended on
//      where the inviter was standing. Not an incompleteness — an ambiguity.
//
// ## What is checked now
//
// The half that STAYS, because it is the other end of the same gesture: minting
// and managing were the copy, RECEIVING an invite lives here by construction —
// a link arrives at an app, and the app has to honour it. So: `POST /v1/join`
// with the identity attached, and the server's own sentence when it refuses.
//
// Plus the link that replaced the panel, and the fence.
//
// `fetch` is stubbed, so this runs with no node and no network.
