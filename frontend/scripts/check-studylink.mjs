// STUDY LINK · what «open this study in EMStudio» resolves to, and the two
// silences that made a failure look like a success.
//
//   node scripts/check-studylink.mjs
//
// Two bugs are pinned here, one of each kind, and both were found by measuring
// rather than by reading:
//
//  1. **AMBIGUITY WAS PREFERRED, NOT REFUSED** (5 September 2026). `?emjson=`
//     won over `?study=` in silence, so a link whose two halves named different
//     studies loaded one of them and labelled it with the other — the status bar
//     said «Villa di Aiano» over a page opened as Porta Marina, the address bar
//     was cleaned because the success branch had run, and there was no toast and
//     no log line. The URL that produces it is the ordinary one: you edit
//     `study=` and leave `emjson=` where it was.
//
//     `handoff.ts` had the right rule three hours earlier in the same tree — a
//     link naming both a room and a study is refused — and it was not carried
//     across. So this file measures BOTH readers against the same principle.
//
//  2. **THE ORDER WAS A COINCIDENCE.** The study link won over the restored
//     workspace only because its `fetch` happened to resolve after
//     `applyWorkspace`. A link is an explicit request and a restore is a habit,
//     so the link must win — and that has to be written down, which is what the
//     boot assertions at the end are about.
