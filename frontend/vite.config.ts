// `viteSingleFile` works by inlining every dynamic import into one bundle, and
// rollup refuses that with more than one entry. Since the single-file property
// is exactly what both pages are for (the editor must open over `file://`, the
// viewer must be servable from anywhere without an asset path to get wrong),
// the answer is to run the same config twice:
//
//   npm run build          → dist/index.html   (the editor)
//   npm run build:reader   → dist/reader.html  (the dissemination viewer, P3)
//
// `EM_ENTRY=reader` picks the second. It is `reader` and not `viewer` because
// `viewer.html` is already taken by the phase-2 read-only SVG GRAPH viewer —
// that one draws the matrix, this one reads the story. They share every module that matters — the
// narrative renderer, the embeds, the palette — so the viewer is a second ENTRY,
// never a second implementation.

// ── WHERE THE DEV SERVER LIVES, and why it is not `/` ───────────────────────
//
// In development EMStudio is reached THROUGH the node's own origin, at
// `/em/studio/` (`stratigraph-server/dev-stack/Caddyfile.dev`), and the reason is
// not tidiness: served on a port of its own, the editor cannot fetch a study
// container from the Catalog at all — the browser refuses it as cross-origin and
// the Catalog sends no CORS headers, measured in Chrome on 4 September as
// «Study unreachable — TypeError: Failed to fetch». Same origin, and the question
// does not arise. (The alternative was `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` on the
// Catalog, which is not the repair of a missing permission but a permission
// given to everybody.)
//
// So the dev server's `base` is that path, and the asset URLs Vite writes into
// its HTML carry it. Vite redirects `/` to the base, so `localhost:5173` still
// works for anybody who prefers the port.
//
// `EM_DEV_BASE=/` restores the old behaviour for a run that wants it.
// PRODUCTION is untouched: there the base stays `./` (see below), which is the
// property that lets the editor open from `file://` and the reader be served
// from any prefix.

  // The editor is one file, so its base is moot. The reader is a shell that
  // asks for `./assets/reader-*.{js,css}` — and, when a model appears,
  // `./three.module-*.js` beside them — every one of which the browser resolves
  // against the URL DIRECTORY the shell came from. StratiGraph Catalog therefore serves
  // the whole `dist/` as a directory and puts the shell at its root
  // (`/catalog/reader/reader.html`, `app/main.py::READER_MOUNT`), and the
  // requests land.
  //
  // An ABSOLUTE base (`/catalog/reader/`) would work for exactly that one
  // deployment and break every other: a different prefix, a Caddy sub-path, a
  // reader opened from a file manager. Relative asks nothing of the host but
  // that the shell and its assets stay together, which is what a dist IS.

  // env var of ours). The dev server takes `devBase` instead: it is served

  // every module request resolve against whatever directory the page was asked
  // for. Two situations, two answers, one line each.
