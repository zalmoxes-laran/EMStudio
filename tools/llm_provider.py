"""Provider-neutral seam for calling a language model, for em-bridge (N5).

**Why this lives here and not in s3Dgraphy.** s3Dgraphy is pure: no web
framework, no network, no optional heavy SDKs. That is what makes it embeddable
in Blender, in a notebook and in this bridge without dragging anything along.
A model call is network, so it lives in the bridge — which is already the local
access layer and already bundles s3Dgraphy.

**Provider-neutral.** :class:`LLMProvider` is the whole contract: one method.
Claude is the first adapter, not the interface — adding OpenAI, a local
llama.cpp, or a stub for tests means registering another adapter, never editing
a caller.

**The key.** Read from the environment at call time, never persisted, never
logged, never returned in a response, and never sent to the frontend. If it is
missing the provider says so with a clear error instead of failing somewhere
deeper.

**What is sent.** Only the briefing built by
``s3dgraphy.api.build_narrative_generation_context`` — one activity, its units,
their epochs and the evidence already recorded for them. Not the whole graph,
not the file, not the user's paths. Documented in :func:`describe_payload`.
