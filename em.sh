# EMStudio dev/build/release helper — one entry point, the same ergonomics as
# EMtools' `em.sh`. Two halves:
#
#   the FRONTEND chain (sync/build/wasm/all/dev) — the EMStudio frontend is a
#   browser/TS app that bundles the EM datamodels at BUILD time (it cannot import
#   the Python s3dgraphy at runtime), so refreshing them is a build step;
#
#   the RELEASE chain (inc/pack/devrel/ghrelease/s3d/doc) — one command bumps the
#   app version, tags and pushes, and GitHub Actions builds the desktop app for
#   macOS (arm64 + Intel), Windows and Linux.
#
# THE ORDER THAT MATTERS, and the reason `s3d` is in here: the desktop app ships a
# FROZEN Python sidecar (`em-bridge`) built against the s3dgraphy version pinned in
# `tools/requirements.txt`. That build is reproducible only if the pin is published
# on PyPI, so `devrel` REFUSES to tag when it is not. Publish the s3dgraphy dev
# first (in the s3Dgraphy repo: `./bump_and_push.sh`), then release EMStudio.
#
# Usage:
#   ./em.sh sync   [s3Dgraphy]   Refresh the vendored EM datamodels (visual rules,
#                                node/edge models, qualia vocab, 2D icons) from a
#                                s3Dgraphy checkout OR the installed s3dgraphy.
#                                No arg = auto-detect.
#   ./em.sh build                Build the single-file frontend (dist/).
#   ./em.sh wasm                 Rebuild em-core → WASM (needs Rust/cargo).
#   ./em.sh all    [s3Dgraphy]   sync → wasm → build (sync/wasm best-effort).
#   ./em.sh dev    [args…]       Start the dev stack (bridge + Vite → ./dev.sh).
#
#   ./em.sh version              What version is set, per file.
#   ./em.sh inc                  Bump the dev counter (1.6.0-dev.2 → -dev.3).
#   ./em.sh s3d status [--check] The pinned s3dgraphy: is it published? is the
#                                local checkout ahead of it? `--check` also
#                                EXITS non-zero on a bad verdict — that is what
#                                the CI workflow runs, so the gate is one
#                                function and not two.
#   ./em.sh s3d pin <version>    Move the pin (refuses one that is not on PyPI).
#   ./em.sh doc    [path]        Build the manual (EMStudio-doc) as a CHECK: -W,
#                                with the version aligned to this app.
#   ./em.sh pack                 Build the desktop app LOCALLY (sidecar + Tauri)
#                                for this machine only.
#   ./em.sh devrel [--dry-run] [--yes] [--if-changed]
#                                A dev release: gate → inc → commit → tag → push.
#                                GitHub Actions then builds the four installers.
#   ./em.sh ghrelease <x.y.z>    A stable release at an exact version.
#   ./em.sh help
#
# In a DISTRIBUTED build the datamodels are already inlined into dist/index.html
# (and the Tauri app), so the end user needs neither Python nor s3dgraphy.

#: Is this exact version on PyPI? Three outcomes, and the third is why this is a
#: function and not a one-liner: published / not published / COULD NOT CHECK. A
#: gate that cannot reach the index must not answer "yes" — that is how an
#: unpublishable release gets tagged on a train with no wifi.
#: 0 = published · 1 = not published · 2 = could not verify
#:
#: THE FALSE NEGATIVE THIS SURVIVES, measured on 23 Aug 2026 and the reason the
#: shape below is not the obvious one: `./em.sh s3d pin 1.6.0.dev15` accepted the
#: pin (it asks this same function) and, seconds later, `./em.sh devrel` refused
#: with "s3dgraphy==1.6.0.dev15 is NOT on PyPI" — while dev15 was published and
#: downloadable. Two consecutive calls to ONE function disagreed about a
#: published package, which means the answer was never about the package:
#:
#:   · a release pushed seconds ago is not yet consistent on every CDN edge
#:     (PyPI is behind Fastly), so one request can see the new file and the next,
#:     landing on another edge, cannot;
#:   · and `pip download` WITHOUT `--no-cache-dir` may serve a stale simple index
#:     out of pip's own HTTP cache — a cache of "this version does not exist",
#:     which is the worst possible thing to remember for ten minutes.
#:
#: This gate runs at exactly the moment a release was just pushed. So: never a
#: cache, and a hard negative is RETRIED a couple of times before it is believed.
#: A "cannot verify" is NOT retried into a yes — an unreachable index stays
#: fail-closed immediately, because retrying a network error until it looks like
#: an answer is how a fail-closed gate quietly becomes a fail-open one.
#:
#: AND THE THING THAT MAKES THE THREE OUTCOMES REAL, measured while fixing the
#: above: **pip cannot tell you which of them happened.** With the index pointed
#: at a dead port, and again at a hostname that does not resolve, `pip download`
#: says exactly what it says for a version that was never published —
#:
#:     ERROR: Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement … (from versions: none)
#:     ERROR: No matching distribution found for …
#:
#: — so classifying on those two lines (which is what this did before) reported a
#: laptop with no network as "publish it first". The verdict stayed a refusal, so
#: nothing opened up; the SENTENCE was wrong, and it sends somebody to publish a
#: package that is already published. The transport question therefore has to be
#: asked separately, of the index itself, and it is asked FIRST: a server that
#: answers means the "no" is about the version; a server that does not answer
#: means we do not know.

#: How hard the probe tries before believing a NO. Overridable so a measurement
#: (or a nightly in a hurry) can tighten it; the worst case is bounded on purpose
#: — `(attempts - 1) × wait` seconds of waiting, i.e. ~10 s by default, never a hang.
EM_PROBE_ATTEMPTS="${EM_PROBE_ATTEMPTS:-3}"
EM_PROBE_WAIT="${EM_PROBE_WAIT:-5}"
#: The wall-clock deadline for ONE probe. With the defaults the worst case is
#: `3 × 15 s` of asking plus `2 × 5 s` of waiting — **55 s**, and that is a
#: ceiling, not an estimate: a probe past its deadline is killed.
EM_PROBE_DEADLINE="${EM_PROBE_DEADLINE:-15}"
#: The bound on ONE http request (curl's `--max-time`, which is a total and not a
#: per-address attempt — see `index_says`). Two requests per probe, so the probe
#: itself is ~2× this at worst, inside the deadline above.
EM_PROBE_HTTP="${EM_PROBE_HTTP:-6}"

#: Run a command with a WALL-CLOCK deadline, portably (macOS ships no
#: `timeout(1)`). Returns the command's status, or 124 when the deadline killed it
#: — the number `timeout(1)` uses, so a reader recognises it.
#:
#: A belt over curl's own `--max-time`, and not a redundant one: a bound that
#: trusts one tool's idea of a timeout is not a bound, which is exactly how a
#: ten-second timeout turned into two minutes (see `index_says`).

#: Ask the index whether this exact version is THERE and its bytes are SERVED.
#:
#: Prints one word on stdout — `published` · `absent` · `unreachable` — and a
#: human sentence on stderr. Two bounded requests, both PEP 503:
#:
#:   1. the project page (`<index>/s3dgraphy/`) — does it list a file whose name
#:      carries this exact version?
#:   2. a one-byte range request for that file — do the bytes actually come? A
#:      listing is a promise; one byte is the proof.
#:
#: THREE WRONG ANSWERS CAME BEFORE THIS ONE, each measured, and the order matters
#: because each correction killed the previous diagnosis (23 Aug 2026):
#:
#:   · `pip download` — what this used to run — wedged with **no output at all**,
#:     for `s3dgraphy` and for `six` alike. Blamed pip;
#:   · a bare `urllib` GET of the same page took **40 s**, then over **120 s**,
#:     where `curl` took **0.5 s**. So not pip;
#:   · `getaddrinfo('pypi.org')` returned in **0.00 s** — with **16 addresses**.
#:     So not DNS either.
#:
#: What it is: `urlopen(timeout=N)` bounds ONE connection attempt, and urllib tries
#: those addresses **in order**. On a network where the IPv6 half is a black hole,
#: the total is `attempts × N` — minutes, through a timeout that looks like ten
#: seconds. `curl` does happy-eyeballs (dual-stack in parallel) and `--max-time` is
#: a TOTAL. Hence curl, and hence the outer wall-clock watchdog as well: a bound
#: that trusts one library's idea of a timeout is not a bound.
#:
#: And the question this asks, stated honestly: "the index lists this exact file
#: and its bytes are served" rather than "pip can resolve and download it". That is
#: the NECESSARY condition a packager needs, which is what a gate is for; the
#: sufficient one — `pip install` of the pin with its extras — is exercised for
#: real in CI, on all four runners, by the step that freezes the sidecar from that
#: very pin.
#:
#: `PIP_INDEX_URL` is honoured: a corporate mirror is exactly the case where "is
#: PyPI up" would be the wrong question.

# BUILT, with the version passed as a Sphinx override (`-D version=… -D release=…`).
# So a release verifies that the documentation still compiles and that it carries
# the app's version — with no commit, no dispatch and no token in the doc repo.
