# Build the GraphML transformer sidecar (tools/em_bridge.py + s3Dgraphy)
# into a standalone binary that the Tauri desktop shell spawns at launch.
#
# Output: src-tauri/binaries/em-bridge-<target-triple>  (Tauri externalBin
# naming). The binary is gitignored — CI / packagers run this before
# `cargo tauri build`. On a dev machine it makes desktop GraphML
# import/export work with no external Python.
#
# Needs s3Dgraphy importable (its venv has pyinstaller + pandas + lxml):
#   (cd ../../s3Dgraphy && python3 -m venv .venv \
#      && .venv/bin/pip install -e '.[sync,minio,geo,docx]' pandas lxml pyinstaller)
# The [minio] extra enables the /ingest-minio + /presign endpoints in the
# sidecar; without it those endpoints 501 gracefully (like TTL without rdflib).
# The [geo] extra (pyproj) enables /reproject + /georeference-scene, i.e. the map
# for projected coordinates. The [docx] extra (python-docx) enables the Word
# export — pure Python, so there is nothing native to find and no reason to leave
# it out of a packaged app. For image previews and the narrative FIGURES add,
# optionally:
#   .venv/bin/pip install Pillow cairosvg
# cairosvg turns the client-rendered SVG of a matrix into the PNG a .docx needs
# and the PDF a .tex needs. It binds the NATIVE libcairo, which a wheel does not
# carry (macOS: `brew install cairo`; Debian/Ubuntu: `apt-get install
# libcairo2`), so it is bundled only when the build machine has it and the
# figures fall back to placeholders when it does not.
# pyproj and Pillow are bundled if present in the build venv; PyMuPDF is
# EXCLUDED on purpose (22 MB for a PDF cover — dev-only, see below). Each of them
# degrades to the previous behaviour when absent.
#
# Full packaging instructions for the three OSes, including how the PROJ data
# directory gets into the binary and how to VERIFY it afterwards, live in
# ../../docs/DEVELOPMENT.md § "Packaging the desktop app". Keep them there, not
# duplicated here.
#
# Usage:
#   ./build-bridge.sh                 # uses ../../s3Dgraphy

# PyInstaller's analysis follows imports inside FUNCTION BODIES, so a library that
# the bridge imports lazily (pyproj inside api.reproject_many, PIL inside
# _thumbnail) is bundled whenever it is installed in the build venv, flags or no
# flags: builds with and without these `--collect-submodules` came out the same
# size to the megabyte. What the flags add is the part the analysis CANNOT infer —
# the PROJ data directory and the package metadata. And the only way to keep a
# library OUT is `--exclude-module` (see PyMuPDF below, verified: 47 MB → 26 MB).
#
#   pyproj   (G1/G3) — EPSG → WGS84. Wheels BUNDLE PROJ, so no system GDAL is
#                      needed; the PROJ data directory must travel or the frozen
#                      binary finds no datum grids.
#   Pillow   (G2)    — server-side image thumbnails. Pays for itself: a 2 MB
#                      orthophoto travels as ~40 kB instead of 2.9 MB of base64.
# Together they measure +8 MB (18 MB → 26 MB) on this machine.

# The narrative FIGURES (a matrix drawn by the client, arriving as SVG). cairosvg
