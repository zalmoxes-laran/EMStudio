// "transformer" service exposing /graphml + /import-graphml. That service is
// PLUGGABLE:
//   * EM_TRANSFORMER_URL set  → use that endpoint (e.g. a remote StratiGraph
//     server, one of several dockerised services) and start nothing locally;
//   * otherwise               → spawn the bundled `em-bridge` sidecar
//     (tools/em_bridge.py frozen with s3Dgraphy, see build-bridge.sh) on
//     localhost and use it — the silent local pipe.
// The frontend asks which URL to use via the `transformer_url` command.

//   * it NEVER reaches the frontend — no localStorage, no em.json, no log. The
//     webview can set it, clear it, and ask whether one exists; it can never
//     read it back.
//   * it lives in the OS keychain, not in a file we wrote.
//   * it reaches the model only through em-bridge's ENVIRONMENT, which is where
//     `tools/llm_provider.py` reads `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` at call time.
//
// Without a keychain (a browser-served dev build) there is no safe place to put
// it, so the frontend says so and the user exports the env var before ./dev.sh.
// Degrading to "store it in plain text" would be worse than not offering it.
