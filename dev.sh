#!/usr/bin/env bash
# EMStudio dev launcher (macOS / Linux).
#
# Starts, together, the iterative dev stack:
#   1. the Python GraphML bridge (tools/em_bridge.py) — backs the in-app
#      "GraphML" export button; runs s3Dgraphy in-process.
#   2. the Vite frontend dev server (npm run dev) — live reload, no Tauri
#      rebuild needed.
#
# Both stop together on Ctrl-C. No desktop-app compile in the loop: edit
# frontend/src or the s3Dgraphy exporter, save, and just reload the browser
# (frontend HMR is instant; the bridge re-imports s3Dgraphy per request, so a
# Python edit only needs a bridge restart — Ctrl-C and re-run this script).
#
# Usage:
#   ./dev.sh                 # bridge :8765 + frontend :5173
#   ./dev.sh --port 8888     # override bridge port
#   S3DGRAPHY=/path/src ./dev.sh   # override s3Dgraphy src location

# process actually holding :5173 is the `node` that `npm` spawns two levels down.
# So Ctrl-C killed the bridge (whose pid was the real one) and Vite survived,
# kept the port, and the next `./dev.sh` slid onto 5174 — where Caddy's
# `/em/studio/` route, which points at 5173, finds nothing. Measured on E.D.'s
# machine as TWO Vite processes from this checkout, one of them orphaned.
#
# `set -m` gives every background job a process group of its own, so
# `kill -- -PID` reaches the whole tree instead of the shell that started it.
